# Registeration Form

Tried to implement basic Registration Form including Server Side validations on the form fields using Hibernate API validator. Implemented some CSS also to give it a look and feel.

Below is the demo of the Registration Page flow.

<b> Future Improvements: </b>
<ul>
  <li> Will connect this Registration Form with Database (MySQL) using Hibernate </li>
  <li> Will add more links to register and to see all users who have already registered. </li>
</ul>
